# 100 Days of Code with Dr. Angela Yu
This repository is a collection of all my projects, exercises, and experiments as I work through 100 days of coding in Python. The goal is to build consistency, learn new concepts, and apply programming to real-world problems.

# 📖 About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is designed to encourage daily coding practice for 100 consecutive days. Each day, I work on a new concept, project, or improvement to solidify my skills.
