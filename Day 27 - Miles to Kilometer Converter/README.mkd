# Miles to Kilometers Converter

This is a beginner GUI program that converts miles to kilometers using a simple interface built with **Tkinter**.

### What I Practiced
- Introduction to **GUI programming** in Python
- Using **Tkinter** to create windows, labels, buttons, and input fields
- Handling user input and basic calculations

###  How It Works
1. The user enters a value in miles.
2. Clicks the "Calculate" button.
3. The program displays the equivalent distance in kilometers.

This was my first step into building interactive programs with a graphical interface
