# U.S. States Guessing Game üó∫Ô∏è

This is a simple Python game that helps you learn all 50 U.S. states by testing your recall and spelling.

## How It Works

- A blank map of the United States is displayed.
- You're prompted to guess the name of a state.
- If your guess is **correctly spelled** and **valid**, the state's name appears on the map near its location.
- You can keep guessing until you've named all 50 states or choose to end the game early.

## Ending the Game

- To end the game at any time, type `"exit"`.
- A `.csv` file will be automatically created containing the list of states you missed.
- Use the file to study and improve for next time!

## Requirements

- Python
- Turtle module (built-in)
- Pandas
