# ðŸ“Š Programming Language Popularity (2008â€“2020)

This project, completed as part of **Day 73: Advanced Data Visualization with Matplotlib**, explores the popularity trends of different programming languages over time using real-world data from Stack Overflow.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The dataset captures the number of Stack Overflow posts tagged with specific programming languages, spanning from **2008 to 2020**. Each post is treated as a signal of interest or activity, allowing us to track which languages gained or lost popularity over the years.

This project focused on:
- Practicing advanced data visualization techniques using `matplotlib`
- Interpreting time-series data
- Comparing the relative popularity of major programming languages

## ðŸ“‚ Data Source

The data was derived from Stack Overflow post metadata, where each entry represents the number of posts for a given language in a given month or year. The assumption is that the number of posts reflects community engagement and usage of that language during that period.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Skills Practiced

- ðŸ“ˆ **Time-series visualization** with `matplotlib`
- ðŸŽ¯ Plot styling (colors, labels, legends, titles)
- ðŸ“Š Comparing multiple categories over time
- ðŸ§¼ Basic data preparation with `pandas`
- ðŸ’¡ Deriving insights from visual data

## ðŸ“· Sample Output

> _Note: Insert or describe a sample plot here if available, such as a line chart comparing Python, JavaScript, and Java over time._

## âœ… What I Learned

- How to create multi-line plots to compare categories across time
- Formatting visual elements to improve clarity and presentation
- Interpreting real-world developer data
- The role of data visualization in understanding technology trends

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
